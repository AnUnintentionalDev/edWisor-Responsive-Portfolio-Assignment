# edWisor-Responsive-Portfolio-Assignment

This is the second part of Level 2 Front end Design and Responsive Web Design assignment of edWisor's Front End Developer career path. I have 
used sass very first time in this process along with ui kit framework. It's is a very simple single page website, which highlighlights
different things about me, my skills, work and contact. Please share some reviews and comments as soon as you see this. I would highly
appreciate them all. Thanks
